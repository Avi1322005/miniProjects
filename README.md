# 🧠 Python Mini Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python mini projects. These projects are great for learning programming basics like conditionals, loops, user input handling, and functions.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. 🧮 BMI Calculator
**File:** `BMI_calculator.py`  
Calculate Body Mass Index based on user input for height and weight, and categorize the result as underweight, normal, or overweight.

### 2. ➕ Basic Calculator
**File:** `calculator.py`  
A simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It runs in a loop allowing repeated operations.

### 3. ⌛ Click On Time Game
**File:** `Click_on_time.py`  
A game where the user has to press Enter exactly after 10 seconds. It gives feedback on timing accuracy.

### 4. 🎯 Number Guessing Game
**File:** `Number_guessing_game.py`  
User tries to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. The program gives hints to guess higher or lower until correct.

### 5. 📝 Random Quote Generator
**File:** `Random_Quotes.py`  
Displays random motivational or famous quotes every few seconds using a list of 100 quotes and the `random` module.

### 6. 💸 Tip Splitter
**File:** `Tip_Splitter.py`  
Calculates how much each person should pay including a tip, based on their individual contributions.

### 7. 🏧 ATM Simulator
**File:** `ATM.py`  
Simulates basic ATM operations: deposit, withdraw, and check balance. Includes checks for insufficient funds and reusability.

### 8. ⏰ Alarm Clock  
**File:** `Alarm_Clock.py`  
A simple alarm clock where the user inputs a time in 24-hour format (`HH:MM`). When the system time matches the alarm time, it plays an alarm sound using the `playsound` module.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `playsound` library (only for Alarm Clock)
- Other projects use only built-in modules (`random`, `time`, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository and run any Python file using:

```bash
python filename.py
